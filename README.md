# Implementation-and-Exploration-of-Chess
This is the first part in a larger project. In this part, the game of chess was implemented from scratch, a visual representation mechanism was set up, a simple random selector with no pruning strategy was programmed, a database for this strategy to store its experiences playing games against others was created, and an exchange system was set up against another chess engine called Sunfish (https://github.com/thomasahle/sunfish).
